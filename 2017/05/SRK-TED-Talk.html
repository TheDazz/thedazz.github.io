<h1>SRK talks about his son's MMS, terrorism, Ra.One's failure, midlife crisis, his early struggles and more in his TED talk</h1>
<p>Shah Rukh Khan delivers an excellent speech on how humanity's future is a reflection of his life as he talks about his struggles and adventures.</p>

<p>
Shah Rukh Khan began his first ever TED talk in Vancouver with "Namaskar, I am a movie star, I'm 51 years of age and I don't use Botox as yet."
</p>
<p>
"I sell dreams, and I peddle love to millions of people." 
</p>
<p>
“I’ve also been made to understand that there are lots of you who haven’t seen my work and I feel very sad for you,” jokes SRK.
</p>
<p>
In his charming persona, Shah Rukh Khan talks about how internet (especially twitter) changed his life, how he got to meet Angelina Jolie for only 2 seconds, how he dealt with losing both his parents, how his attempt on creating a superhero film failed, how SRK's own baby was claimed on the internet to be his elder son's love child which was alongside a fake MMS video and how he and his family dealt with it.
</p>
<p>
The main focus of the TED talk was how the world can be changed by spreading love and not hatred.
