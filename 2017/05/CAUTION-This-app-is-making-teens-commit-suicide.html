<h2>An app that is truly a killer</h2>
<p>Yeah! You heard it right. An app that provokes teens to commit suicide like in the 2016 movie Nerve is wreaking havoc in countries such as Russia from where it is suspected to have originated. This app known as the ‘blue whale app’ throws a suicide challenge known as’ the blue whale challenge’. The game is increasingly gripping the interest of teens and now have found followers in Portugal apart from UK, Brazil and Dubai. The situation is probably getting a little tough as schools abroad are sending advisories to parents to put a strict watch on what their children are downloading.
</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>
The motive of the app is to brainwash the children by throwing them 50 challenges in span of 50 days with each challenge being more severe and dangerous than the previous one. It includes self-mutilation, watching scary movies at night, waking up at odd hours, listening to frightening and sorrowful music sent by the curator himself and the last challenge being to take your life. However, the catch here is that once you download the game and agree to its demands you cannot back out. You may think of uninstalling the app but mate it’s impossible to do so. Moreover, the software present in the game completely hacks your phone. Even then if somehow you manage to skip the challenge the curator threatens to get your parents killed as he has all your information. Also this highly illegal game is available only to a closed community. So instead of teenagers seeking the game the game seeks its victims.
</p>
<h2>How are children influenced to play such a game?</h2>
<p>
When asked about why children still play the game even when they know it will lead to their death, a leading psychologist says the children lose their thinking power over a period of 50 days. Also the thrill factor is there just like in video games where you want to do anything just to finish the game and attain a level of self-satisfaction. Also the fact that teens are asked to join the game instead of them searching it adds to the novelty factor.
</p>
<h2>This needs to stop right now!</h2>
<p>
Parents need to understand that the world is changing fast. There has to be a level of understanding between the children and their parents who can guide them when they go wrong. Teens sometimes cannot understand the severity of the game and think that they will emerge victorious. Parents need to keep the track of the online activities of their children and for now should talk about the game till some solution is not found. But thankfully the game has not come in India till date and we hope the case remains the same in future as well.
